"""Seed-bootstrap CIs for the board-level tau curves.

The headline tau (0.21) carries seed-bootstrap 95% intervals; the horizon and universe curves were reported as bare points. This
script computes the same cluster bootstrap (resample seeds with replacement,
recompute mean-Sharpe boards, 10,000 draws, fixed RNG) for every cleanly
reconstructible curve point:

- direct 9-agent horizon board (ds_h* + glm_h* merged), E0 vs E1, high_vol;
- routed 9-agent horizon board (routed_h*), E0 vs E1, high_vol;
- 12-agent universe boards at N=3 and N=5, E0 vs E1, high_vol.

Writes docs/results/execution_sensitivity_scaffold/tau_curve_cis.csv (released
with the artifact; the N=10 assembly is coverage-restricted across several
result dirs and keeps its published point estimates).
