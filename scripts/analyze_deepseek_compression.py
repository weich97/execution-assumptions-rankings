"""Compression curves with explicit access-path provenance.

E0->E1 Kendall tau_b is reported in the high-volatility regime at universe
sizes N in {2,3,5,10}. The direct-only GLM boards intentionally have no N=2
point because that matrix contains only the routed ``poe:glm-5`` identity;
silently substituting it for ``glm:glm-5`` would splice two interfaces into a
curve labeled direct. A separate full-board row retains that historical splice
as an explicitly labeled diagnostic. The paper's fixed 11-policy descriptive
curve uses deepseek direct plus the same three routed policy identities at every
N and never performs the GLM route swap.
