# Execution-Assumption Sensitivity (Deterministic Agents)

How much the agent ranking reorders between execution-assumption levels.
Rankings use mean Sharpe over seeds within each (scenario, level) cell.
Kendall tau-b of 1.0 means the ladder level did not reorder the leaderboard;
lower values mean execution assumptions change conclusions.
